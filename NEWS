* Changes in opensource COBOL 1.3J

** New features

*** Unicode (UTF-8 encoding) support. Add --enable-utf8 option to 'configure' parameters 
    to activate. Without the option, SHIFT-JIS support is default for the configure.
    The features of Unicode support are:
    1. allocate 3 bytes for single 'N' in PICUTURE clause.
    2. unit of arguments in reference modification and parameter values in
       INSPECT statement are bytes (not a count of characters).
    3. padding blank by half-with (1 byte for each) spaces.
    4. suppress check for mixed full-witdth/half-width char. strings in
       STRING statement parameters.
    * These semantics of the UTF-8 support may change in the future.

*** Support some of COBOL dialect and unsupported statements/functions frequently used 
    in existing COBOL program assets.

    (default-currency-symbol)

*** length check limits are loosen, and enable to be changed in conf. setting.
    (max-alpha-character-data-size for alnum, default to 2147483647,

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Changes in opensource COBOL 1.2J

** Support Feature of Japanese, such as constant and definition of data and operation of data.

** New compile option '-assign_external' and variable 'assign_external=[yes|no]'. Set the 
   file assign to the EXTERNAL file.

** New compile option '-free_1col_aster'. In free format COBOL mode, this option causes the
   compiler to regard as line comment when first column is asterisk for free format COBOL mode.

** New runtime environment variable OC_USERFH, which enable to run user-defined program in 
   operation OPEN, CLOSE, DELETE, READ, REWRITE, START, WRITE, COMMIT, ROLLBACK and UNLOCK.

** Support currency symbol for Japanese yen, and modify default currency symbol to
   Japanese yen.

** Changed to apply the alphabetic manner as comparison method in case its operands include 
   group fields.

** Fixed the problem that INSPECT causes incorrect result in case given the AFTER/BEFORE 
   clause with negative value or SIGN SEPARATE field. 

** Fixed the problem that value comparison on SIGN SEPARATE fields in IF or EVALUATE 
   statements fails treating such field values as if their sign character were a part of 
   digits.

** Fixed the problem that applying INITIALIZE on 01-level records in EXTERNAL files causes 
   incorrect behavior of following I/O instructions.

** Changed the default actions on unhandled SIZE ERROR according to that specified in 
   Programmer's Guide.

** Fixed the problem that applying INITIALIZE or MOVE ZERO on numeric field of SIGN SEPARATE 
   destroys sign byte.

** Fixed the problem that COPY statement ignores the last line of each copybook when it does 
   not end with line break.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* OpenCOBOL 1.0 released

* Changes in OpenCOBOL 0.33

** New compile option '-x'. This causes the compiler to produce an
   executable program. '-fmain' is deprecated.

** Remove long option --verbose. Use '-v' for verbosity. Problem is
   with getopt_long_only which does not like eg. -mv 

** New conformity option -std=bs2000.

** FUNCTION is implemented. See cobc/reserved.c for a list of what is
   implemented.

** Nested programs are partially supported.

** LINAGE is implemented.

** EXTERNAL on FD is implemented.

** SAME RECORD AREA is implemented.

** New config variables - 
   "perform-osvs", "sticky-linkage". These are
   activated for -std=ibm and -std=mvs.
   "relax-level-hierarchy". Allows mismatched data
   description level numbers. Activated for
   -std=mf, ibm, mvs and bs2000.

** Support for non-gcc compilers.

** Large file support, system dynamic loading and Berkeley DB inclusion
   are default for the configure.
   ie. ./configure assumes --with-db --with-lfs64 --with-dl

** New configure option --with-patch-level=<n>
   Default is 0. 

** At run time, version checking is done. ie. When executing/loading
   Cobol programs, the version (eg. 0.33) and the patch level (eg. 0)
   are checked against the OC library version/patch level.

** Libtool is not required for systems that support native dynamic
   loading. This includes Linux, Cygwin and MingW amongst others.

** Note to developers : See README for required software versions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Changes in OpenCOBOL 0.32

** Stability update - See individual ChangeLogs

** New internal register - NUMBER-OF-CALL-PARAMETERS

** New config variables - larger-redefines-ok, relaxed-syntax-check

** Powerpc changes - We now pass all OC and Cobol85 tests

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Changes in OpenCOBOL 0.31

** Stability update - See individual ChangeLogs

** New driver program - "cobcrun"
   This allows all application programs to be compiled as
   modules and driven by "cobcrun" similar to MF's "cobrun".
   Syntax - cobcrun <MAINPROG> [Arguments to program "MAINPROG"]
   As "cobcrun" is linked with the static version of Open Cobol
   libraries, it is easier to maintain concurrent versions on the
   same system.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
